# DiscordPlays
A Discord bot that allows users in a channel to play an emulated game, in the manner of Twitch Plays Pok√©mon.

For the time being, the bot will be kept lightweight and emulator-agnostic, meaning that it will only wrap around the emulator and feed inputs to it, without interfacing directly.
